[bdist_wheel]
# This flag says to generate wheels that support both Python 2 and Python
# 3. If your code will not run unchanged on both Python 2 and 3, you will
# need to generate separate wheels for each Python version that you
# support. Removing this line (or setting universal to 0) will prevent
# bdist_wheel from trying to make a universal wheel. For more see:

# tests_require is a list of dependencies that are *absolutely required*
# to run the tests. tests_require is used when running tests from your
# *current* Python environment (that is, not using tox).
# tests_require is ignored by tox.
#
# As such, you can usually get away with neglecting tests_require ---
# it's not a big deal if some of the dependencies get left out.
#
# If you're running tests from your current environment, it's because
# you're actively developing, in which case you usually have an
# environment you built for development. But if you have to change
# environments mid-development for any reason, tests_require can save you
# from getting tripped up.
#
# tests_require is used when running tests and debugging through an IDE like
# PyCharm, to ensure the environment the IDE is using has the requirements.
#
# Unless you're in one of those situations, you can simply ignore this.
